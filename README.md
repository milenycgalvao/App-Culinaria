## Overview

This is a study project that still not over yet, it is on the section 7 of Flutter couse "Aprenda Flutter e Desenvolva Apps Para Android e IOS 2021" of Udemy. The main objective this project is working with navegation and multiple screens.


To work with navegation in your project you can use routes, creating a pile of screens that you can call when you need. The way used in this project is in the file `lib/main.dart`:

```
routes: {
        AppRoutes.HOME: (ctx) => const CategoriesScreen(),
        AppRoutes.CATEGORIES_MEALS: (ctx) => const CategoriesMealsScreen(),
        AppRoutes.MEAL_DETAIL: (ctx) => MealDetailScreen(),
      },
```


In the file `lib/routes/app_rotes.dart` itÂ´s creat the name of routes that we call on the above code and in the moments that we needed it on the application. This is a way to avoid typos in the code and is created in this code:

```
class AppRoutes {
  static const HOME = '/';
  static const CATEGORIES_MEALS = '/categories-meals';
}
```


To call the screen that we want we use the command `Navigator.of(context).pushNamed()`. We use it on the file `lib/components/category_item.dart` on the function that it will be call on the moment that the user touched. Here we use the `arguments` because we need to know what will be show and this depends on which category the user touched.

```
void _selectCategory(BuildContext context) {
    Navigator.of(context).pushNamed(
      AppRoutes.CATEGORIES_MEALS,
      arguments: category,
    );
  }
```
